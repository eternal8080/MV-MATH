        "question": "Uncle Wang needs to make a ladder as shown in Figure 1. The ladder has 8 parallel steps, and the distance between each pair of adjacent steps is equal. It is known that the length of the topmost step $A_{1} B_{1}=0.5 \\mathrm{~m}$, and the length of the bottommost step $A_{8} B_{8}=0.8 \\mathrm{~m}$. When making these steps, the carpenter cuts the wooden boards longer than the steps to ensure that a tenon of $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ (as shown in Figure 2) can be made at each end of every step for fixing the steps. Now, there are wooden boards of $2.1 \\mathrm{~m}$ in the market that can be used to make the steps of the ladder (the width and thickness of the boards are exactly suitable for making the ladder steps). How many such boards does Uncle Wang need to buy at least to make these steps? Please explain the reason. (The loss from sawing is not considered)\n\n<image_1>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<image_2>\n\nFigure 2",

There was a small episode during the installation of the projectors by the workers. As shown in Figure 2, $AB$ represents the height of the classroom, and $CD$ represents the width of the blackboard (points $C$ and $D$ are both on $AB$). To ensure that the students' view of the screen is not obstructed, the projector must be installed at point $E$, where $CE \\perp AB$ and $CE = 1.2$ meters. Due to the excessive weight of the projector, the horizontal axis $(CE)$ is insufficient to support it, so the workers decided to use some iron wire $(EF)$ for reinforcement, with point $F$ on the height of the classroom $AB$. During installation, the workers found that when $\\angle CEF = 30^\\circ$, the fixing coefficient at point $F$ was poor. Through practice, it was discovered that when point $F$ is moved upwards to point $G$ and $\\angle CEG = 40^\\circ$, the fixing coefficient is optimal. Please calculate how far the workers should move the fixing point $F$ upwards to reach point $G$ (i.e., find $FG$).
