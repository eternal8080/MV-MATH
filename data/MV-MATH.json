As shown in the figure, according to the Pythagorean theorem, \\( 2x^2 = 4 \\), so \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\). The area of the shaded region is:\n\\[\nS_{\\text{shaded}} = 4 \\times 4 - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (4 - \\sqrt{2}) \\times (4 - \\sqrt{2}) = 8\\sqrt{2} - 2 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\n\nC. For Figure C, rotating it \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise and viewing it from the back, it can be compared with Figure D. Since the slope of Figure C is less than that of Figure D, the base of Figure C is smaller than that of Figure D. Both figures have the same height but different bases, so the area of the shaded region in Figure C is less than that in Figure D.\n\nD. As shown in the figure, let the base of the shaded parallelogram be \\( x \\). Therefore, the shorter leg of the right triangle is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 - 16} \\). Since the area of the square equals the area of the shaded region plus the areas of the two blank triangles:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times \\sqrt{x^2 - 16} \\times 2 + 2x = 16.\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = \\frac{8(\\sqrt{7} - 1)}{3} \\).

        "analysis": "The text describes a scenario involving a Reuleaux triangle-shaped cleaning robot ( B) with a circumference of \\(30\\pi\\) cm. The Reuleaux triangle is formed by drawing arcs centered at each vertex of an equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) with side lengths equal to the radius of the arcs. The key steps and conclusions are as follows:\n\n1. **Side Length Calculation**:\n   - Since the circumference of the Reuleaux triangle is \\(30\\pi\\) cm, and it consists of three equal arcs, each arc corresponds to a side of the equilateral triangle.\n   - Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) is:\n     \\[\n     AB = AC = BC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30\\pi = 10\\pi \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n   - However, this is later corrected to \\(AB = AC = BC = 30\\) cm based on the arc length calculation.\n\n2. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - The angles of the equilateral triangle are all \\(60^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB = \\angle ABC = 60^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Arc Length Calculation**:\n   - The length of arc \\(BC\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     BC = \\frac{60 \\times AC \\times \\pi}{180}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     10\\pi = \\frac{60 \\times AC \\times \\pi}{180}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(AC\\):\n     \\[\n     AC = 30 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the side lengths of the equilateral triangle are:\n     \\[\n     AB = AC = BC = 30 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Circumradius Calculation**:\n   - Let \\(O\\) be the circumcenter of the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\). Connecting \\(AO\\) and \\(CO\\), and extending \\(CO\\) to intersect \\(AB\\) at point \\(D\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     CD \\perp AB, \\quad AD = BD = \\frac{1}{2} AB = 15 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n   - The angle \\(\\angle OAD\\) is half of \\(\\angle BAC\\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle OAD = \\angle CAO = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BAC = 30^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - In the right triangle \\(OAD\\), using the cosine of \\(\\angle OAD\\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{AD}{OA}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(OA\\):\n     \\[\n     OA = \\frac{AD}{\\cos 30^\\circ} = \\frac{15}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 10\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the diameter of the circle formed by the rotation of the robot is:\n     \\[\n     2OA = 2 \\times 10\\sqrt{3} = 20\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison of Areas**:\n   - Comparing \\(20\\sqrt{3}\\) cm and \\(30\\) cm:\n     \\[\n     20\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{1200}, \\quad 30 = \\sqrt{900}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(\\sqrt{1200} > \\sqrt{900}\\), it follows that:\n     \\[\n     20\\sqrt{3} > 30\n     \\]\n   - This implies that the area of the \"dead zone\" (the area the robot cannot clean) is larger for robot  B.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The correct answer is **B**.\n\n**Key Insight**: This problem involves understanding the properties of an equilateral triangle and its circumradius, as well as the geometry of the Reuleaux triangle. The key is to correctly calculate the circumradius and use it to determine the diameter of the robot's rotation, which in turn affects the area it can clean."

As shown in Figure 2, two points $A$ and $B$ are selected on the wheel, and the center of the circle where $AB$ lies is denoted as $O$ with a radius of $r \\mathrm{~cm}$.

First, they placed a plane mirror at point $C$. Xiaohua then backed away along the direction of $B C$ until she reached point $E$, where she could just see the image of the top of the Great Wind Pavilion, $A$, in the mirror. The distance from Xiaohua's eyes to the ground, $D E$, was 1.5 meters, and the distance from the mirror to point $E$, $C E$, was 1.2 meters. Next, at a certain moment, the shadow of the Great Wind Pavilion reached its tip at point $M$. At the same time, Xiaoli measured the shadow length of Xiaohua's height, $E G$, which was 0.8 meters, and Xiaohua's height, $E F$, was 1.6 meters.

        "analysis": "Solution: (1) During this motion, the angle $\\angle \\mathrm{BDA}$ gradually increases. When point $\\mathrm{D}$ moves to the position shown in Figure 1, $\\angle \\mathrm{BAD} = 180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{B} - \\angle \\mathrm{BDA} = 75^\\circ$. Therefore, the answer is: larger; $75^\\circ$.\n\n(2) After point $\\mathrm{D}$ moves for $3 \\mathrm{~s}$, it reaches the position shown in Figure 2, where $CD = 3 \\mathrm{~cm}$. At this point, $\\triangle \\mathrm{ABD} \\cong \\triangle \\mathrm{DCE}$. The reasoning is as follows: Since $\\mathrm{AB} = \\mathrm{AC}$ and $\\angle \\mathrm{B} = 30^\\circ$, it follows that $\\angle \\mathrm{C} = 30^\\circ$. Given that $\\mathrm{CD} = \\mathrm{CA} = 3 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $\\angle \\mathrm{CAD} = \\angle \\mathrm{CDA} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (180^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = 75^\\circ$. Consequently, $\\angle \\mathrm{ADB} = 105^\\circ$ and $\\angle \\mathrm{EDC} = 75^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 45^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle \\mathrm{DEC} = 180^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 105^\\circ$, and $\\angle \\mathrm{ADB} = \\angle \\mathrm{DEC}$. In triangles $\\triangle \\mathrm{ABD}$ and $\\triangle \\mathrm{DCE}$, the following conditions hold:\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\angle ADB = \\angle DEC \\\\\nAB = DC \\\\\n\\angle ABD = \\angle DCE\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nThus, $\\triangle \\mathrm{ABD} \\cong \\triangle \\mathrm{DCE}$ (ASA).\n\n(3) The triangle $\\triangle \\mathrm{ADE}$ can be an isosceles triangle in three scenarios:\n\n1. When $\\mathrm{AD} = \\mathrm{AE}$, $\\angle \\mathrm{ADE} = 30^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle \\mathrm{AED} = \\angle \\mathrm{ADE} = 30^\\circ$, and $\\angle \\mathrm{DAE} = 180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{ADE} - \\angle \\mathrm{AED} = 120^\\circ$. Since $\\angle \\mathrm{BAC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{B} - \\angle \\mathrm{C} = 120^\\circ$ and point $\\mathrm{D}$ does not coincide with points $\\mathrm{B}$ or $\\mathrm{C}$, it follows that $\\mathrm{AD} \\neq \\mathrm{AE}$.\n\n2. When $\\mathrm{DA} = \\mathrm{DE}$, $\\angle \\mathrm{ADE} = 30^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle \\mathrm{DAE} = \\angle \\mathrm{DEA} = \\frac{1}{2}(180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{ADE}) = 75^\\circ$. Consequently, $\\angle \\mathrm{BDA} = \\angle \\mathrm{DEC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{AED} = 105^\\circ$.\n\n3. When $\\mathrm{EA} = \\mathrm{ED}$, $\\angle \\mathrm{ADE} = 30^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle \\mathrm{EAD} = \\angle \\mathrm{EDA} = 30^\\circ$, and $\\angle \\mathrm{AED} = 180^\\circ - \\angle \\mathrm{EAD} - \\angle \\mathrm{EDA} = 120^\\circ$.
